# Analysis of Pollution in India
## Aim of this project is analyse dataset of pollution and answer some of the questions.

Since industrialization, there has been an increasing concern about the environmental pollution. Air pollution is the world's largest environment risk and a WHO report links 7 premature million deaths to air pollution. Many cities in India are coming in the list of most polluted places in the world and some of them are considered deadliest. Among the pollutants, SO2 is considered as a by-product of energy and industrial production and is closely linked to prosperity. Beside taking necessary steps to combate pollution, Developing nations also have to bring people out of poverty and that makes the situation worse.

Using this dataset, one can explore India's air pollution levels at a more granular scale.

## Questions
Q1. Is pollution getting worse? i.e. Is concentration of pollutants like so2, no2, pm 2.5 increasing every year.There is a inter-relationship between pollutants, for example, SO2 and NOx can react in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere to form particulate matter (PM) compounds thereby increasing the concentration of pm 2.5 and reducing that of SO2 and NOx.

Q2. Find the States in india which have the highest concentration of pollutants.

Q3. How pollutants varies with seasons?

Q4. What is the difference in pollution levels between the Industrial and and non Industrial zones?
